                        This study investigates the impact of urban form—specifically building alignment—on energy
                        consumption in residential areas. While most research emphasizes reducing energy demand at the
                        individual building level, this work adopts a broader, city-scale perspective. It examines how
                        the spatial configuration of buildings influences thermal loads, offering a new approach to
                        improving urban energy efficiency.
                        <br><br>
                        The research centers on a prototypical urban block of 16 midrise residential buildings in
                        Tehran, a city still experiencing rapid development. Through parametric modeling and energy
                        simulation, three alignment scenarios (X, Y, and XY) are evaluated for their thermal
                        performance. Findings reveal that even minor variations in building layout—such as adjusted
                        spacing or slight misalignments—can significantly influence heating and cooling demands.
                        Notably, combined misalignment in both X and Y directions can reduce primary energy consumption
                        by up to 2.4%, primarily due to changes in solar access and shading. The study demonstrates how
                        strategic urban form can yield measurable energy savings at scale.

                        <h3>Context: Urban Form</h3>
                        <p>As urbanization accelerates, the role of urban form in achieving sustainable development
                            becomes increasingly vital. By 2050, nearly two-thirds of the global population is projected
                            to live in cities, intensifying challenges related to energy demand, climate change, and
                            resource depletion. Yet, much of the current research still concentrates on individual
                            buildings, often overlooking the broader spatial organization of urban environments.</p>
                        <p>Urban form—the physical arrangement of buildings, streets, and open spaces—profoundly affects
                            environmental performance. Factors such as solar access, wind flow, shading, and
                            microclimate are directly influenced by how buildings are positioned relative to one
                            another. These spatial relationships significantly impact energy use. A deeper understanding
                            of urban form can empower planners and designers to make data-informed decisions that
                            improve energy efficiency and resilience at the scale that matters most: the city.</p>

                        <h3>Research Gap: Building Scale vs. Urban Scale</h3>
                        <p>Much of the literature on building energy efficiency focuses on the individual building
                            level, emphasizing high-performance or zero-energy structures. While effective at the micro
                            scale, these solutions often involve complex design, construction, and maintenance
                            processes. More importantly, their cumulative effect on urban-scale energy consumption is
                            often marginal.</p>
                        <p>For example, estimates of residential energy use in Tehran place the baseline demand at
                            approximately 78,114,241 MWh. Even if the city adopted zero-energy residential buildings at
                            the same rate as the U.S. and Canada, the resulting reduction in total energy use would be
                            only 0.87%—a modest improvement given the effort required.</p>
                        <p>This reveals a critical research gap: individual energy-efficient buildings alone cannot
                            drive significant change at the urban level. Our study therefore explores broader strategies
                            that offer moderate savings per unit but can be implemented at scale with lower complexity.
                            Specifically, we investigate how optimizing building alignment within urban
                            blocks—leveraging passive design principles—can enhance energy performance across
                            neighborhoods and cities. By shifting focus from isolated buildings to systemic spatial
                            strategies, this research aims to identify scalable, cost-effective interventions for
                            reducing urban energy use in rapidly growing cities.</p>

                            <p>Introducing controlled misalignment in both X and Y axes can lead to measurable
                                energy
                                savings. The study shows that full misalignment (alignment value = 0.0) can reduce
                                primary
                                energy use by up to 2.4%, primarily due to improved solar exposure, better shading
                                performance, and diversified thermal behavior across the urban block.</p>

                            <p>Comparison of the two main scenarios—(1) adopting zero-energy buildings at the rate
                                seen in
                                the U.S. and Canada, and (2) optimizing building alignment in 70% of Tehran’s

                                areas—reveals a striking difference. The first scenario leads to a negligible
                                reduction of
                                <strong>0.0084%</strong> in total residential energy use, despite the high cost and
                                complexity involved. The second scenario, focused on spatial alignment, results in

                        <h3>Interpretation</h3>
                        <p>These findings demonstrate that building alignment is not merely a visual or planning
                            consideration—it directly influences thermal performance. The results challenge the
                            conventional focus on isolated building design by highlighting the collective energy
                            benefits of urban-scale spatial decisions. However, the study reveals three critical gaps in
                            current urban energy analysis:</p>
                        <ol class="research-gaps">
                            <li><strong>Lack of comprehensive methodology</strong>: No unified framework exists for
                                analyzing energy consumption patterns at city scale, particularly for alignment-based
                                configurations</li>
                            <li><strong>Indicator ambiguity</strong>: Metrics like EUI (Energy Use Intensity) and
                                Primary Energy serve different purposes - where EUI reflects household
                                consumption/costs, Primary Energy relates to macro-level policy and environmental impact
                                - without clear translation between them</li>
                            <li><strong>Definitional inconsistencies</strong>: Key geometric parameters (alignment,
                                density, compactness) lack architecturally operational definitions applicable across
                                planning scales</li>
